To use this script, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as the socket module in Python. You may also need to configure your network settings to communicate with the drone.


Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the script for the Lenovo WiFi drone:



Connect your computer to the same network as the drone.

Replace the drone_ip variable with the IP address of your Lenovo WiFi drone.

Replace the drone_port variable with the communication port of your Lenovo WiFi drone.

Run the script using Python.

The script will send commands to the drone to perform actions such as takeoff, landing, and movement.

Customize the commands according to your desired actions.


Remember, it is crucial to obtain proper authorization before engaging in any drone pentesting activities. Always adhere to ethical standards and legal regulations to protect the privacy and security of others.



To scan for drones, you typically don't need a specific wireless adapter. However, having a wireless adapter that supports monitor mode can greatly enhance your capabilities in detecting and analyzing drone signals.


Monitor mode allows your wireless adapter to capture and analyze all wireless network traffic in the vicinity, including drone signals. This mode enables you to monitor the various drone communication protocols, such as Wi-Fi or other RF frequencies.


To put your wireless adapter into monitor mode, you can use tools like airmon-ng (for Linux) or similar software that supports monitor mode. Here's an example of how you can use airmon-ng to enable monitor mode on a wireless adapter:



Open a terminal or command prompt.

Type sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 (replace wlan0 with the name of your wireless interface).

This command will put your wireless adapter into monitor mode, typically named as wlan0mon.

You can then use tools like airodump-ng to scan for nearby wireless networks, including drones.


Keep in mind that scanning for drones without proper authorization and legitimate reasons may be illegal and unethical. It is essential to respect the privacy of others and comply with relevant laws and regulations.
